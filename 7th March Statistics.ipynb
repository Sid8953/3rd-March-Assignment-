    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1> Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the numbers in the set and then dividing the total by the number of items in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2>Median: The median is the middle value in a set of numbers that are arranged in order. To find the median, you need to sort the numbers in ascending or descending order and then find the middle value. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3>Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of numbers. A set of numbers can have one mode, more than one mode (if two or more values occur with the same highest frequency), or no mode (if no value occurs more frequently than any other value in the set)."

    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to describe the typical or central value in a dataset. However, they differ in the way they are calculated and in their interpretation.\n",

    "The mean is the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the total number of values. It is affected by extreme values, or outliers, in the dataset and may not be a good representation of the central tendency if the dataset has a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in the dataset, such that half of the values are greater than or equal to the median, and the other half are less than or equal to the median. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. It is not affected by extreme values, but it may not exist or may not be unique if there are multiple values with the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the choice of the measure of central tendency depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the research question. For example, the mean is often used when the dataset has a normal distribution, while the median is preferred when the dataset is skewed. The mode is often used when describing categorical data or when looking for the most typical value in a dataset."

The variance is calculated as the average of the squared deviations from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

The variance of Dataset 1 is 62.5, and the standard deviation is 7.91, while the variance of Dataset 2 is 200 and the standard deviation is 14.14, again indicating that the scores in Dataset 2 are more spread out.

The median, on the other hand, is not affected by extreme values and is only influenced by the values in the middle of the distribution. As a result, the median is typically less than the mean in a right-skewed distribution."

However, the magnitude of covariance is difficult to interpret. On the other hand, correlation provides a clear indication of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, and vice versa. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease, and vice versa.\n",
