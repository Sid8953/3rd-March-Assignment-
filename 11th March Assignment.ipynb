    "A one-tailed test: A one-tailed test is used when the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the difference or relationship between the population parameter and the null hypothesis. It is also known as a directional test. For example, suppose we want to test whether a new drug has a higher efficacy rate than the current standard treatment. The one-tailed alternative hypothesis would be that the efficacy rate of the new drug is greater than the efficacy rate of the standard treatment. In this case, we would use a one-tailed test and calculate the p-value for the upper tail of the distribution. A two-tailed test : A two-tailed test is used when the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the difference or relationship between the population parameter and the null hypothesis. It is also known as a non-directional test. For example, suppose we want to test whether there is a significant difference in weight between two groups of people.

    "(i) Type 1 error Type 1 error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This means that we conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there isn't one in reality. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α), and it is typically set to a small value (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) as the maximum allowable probability of making such an error. Example: An example scenario for a Type 1 error is when a medical researcher concludes that a new drug is effective in treating a disease when in fact it is not. This could lead to the drug being prescribed to patients unnecessarily, resulting in potential harm and increased healthcare costs.\n",

    "How does sample size affect the margin of error? The margin of error is affected by several factors, including the level of confidence, sample size, and population variability. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, holding all other factors constant. This is because a larger sample size reduces the sampling error, which is the error that arises due to the random variation in the selection of the sample from the population. larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n",

    "For example, suppose a pollster wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a city who support a particular policy change with 95% confidence and a margin of error of 3%. If the sample size is 400, the margin of error would be around 3.0 percentage points. However, if the sample size is increased to 1600, the margin of error would decrease to around 1.5 percentage points, assuming all other factors remain constant. This means that the larger sample size provides a more precise estimate of the population parameter, and the interval around the point estimate is narrower.\n",
